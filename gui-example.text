Hey,

we've talked a couple weeks ago about writing GUI with McCLIM, and you
said that you will be able to hint me where to start, when I'll clarify
my conception.

Here's a conception of the layout I came with. Would it be feasible to
write it in McCLIM? Also â€“ what platforms are supported by it? How much
work in your opinion will it take to implement such thing?

  Annotation window. Selecting part of the sentence followed with button
  click (Predicate, Agent, Experience, etc. are buttons) should fill the
  appropriate row in the right column. If more predicates are present,
  then selecting one in the list "Other predicates..." should replace
  right column with it's annotated fillers.

  Frame alignment window. This one should be fairly easy. Second and
  third column are filled with fillers from the annotation. User has to
  select one checkbox for each ("correct", "partial", "incorrect"). This
  should be done for each semantic frame (selecatble with prev/next).

There is no rush with it. If you don't have time, please let me
know. I'm currently considering the following toolkits:

- McCLIM
- CommonQt
- LTK
- Custom Weblocks application

I have now some poor-mans command line interface :).

Best regards,
Daniel
